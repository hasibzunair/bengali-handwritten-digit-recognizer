## Intro

I participated in Bengali.AI's Kaggle Machine Learning contest where I placed 6th overall. It scored 97.5% on the testing set. The final codes and model are not added yet. Will be added soon with proper documentation.

## Dependencies 

I have created a virtual environment in Pycharm with the necessary libraries needed. For Windows OS, file directory needs to be changed.

Also, all of these models are trained on CPU of Dell Inspiron 7537 with Linux distro (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) OS.
